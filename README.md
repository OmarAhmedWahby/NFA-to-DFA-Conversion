Automata Theory, also known as the Theory of Computation (TOC) , is a foundational field in computer science and mathematics that studies abstract machines and computational models. It focuses on how problems can be solved using algorithms and how machines (like Finite Automata, Pushdown Automata, and Turing Machines) process inputs and perform computations
Understanding models such as NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automata) and DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata) and the conversion between them plays a crucial role in areas like compiler design, lexical analysis, and pattern matching.
